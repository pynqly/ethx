🦄 ETH Staking Optimizer (Freemium)

ETH Staking Optimizer helps users discover the most efficient and transparent ETH staking yields in real time.
It automatically scans verified DeFi protocols (via DefiLlama and on-chain data), filters noise, and surfaces the best risk-adjusted APYs available across Ethereum-based staking pools.

🔍 Purpose

The mission is simple — make ETH staking smarter, safer, and more accessible.
Most users never see beyond a few centralized platforms. This project removes the guesswork by comparing decentralized yield options side-by-side, showing true returns, liquidity, and TVL quality.
It’s a lightweight, privacy-respecting browser extension — no accounts, no tracking, no wallet access unless you choose to donate.

🧠 Why It Matters

The ETH yield landscape changes daily. New protocols launch, APYs decay, and TVL shifts — often too fast for casual stakers to track.
This project bridges that gap, providing real, data-backed visibility into where Ethereum earns best right now.

By making this tool open and transparent, we aim to help small holders earn like institutions — without depending on hidden algorithms or paywalls.

💜 Support the Project

This extension runs on open infrastructure — no ads, no telemetry, no fees.
If it helps you find better staking returns or save gas fees, consider supporting future development with a small donation.
